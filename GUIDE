File overview:

elfload/
	Obsolete Linux-based ELF loader. This used to allow loading NetWatch
from within an already-running kernel; it could be updated to work with the
current memory layout, but is nonfunctional at the moment. See grubload/ for
the preferred loader.

grubload/
	This is a multiboot-compliant simple ELF loader, for use with NetWatch
aseg.elf images or similar. It loads its input file (passed via multiboot),
invokes the startup routines, and then returns to real mode and starts the
bootloader again.

ich2/
	Intel ICH2 northbridge drivers. A similar API should be implemeted to
port NetWatch to other chipsets.

ich7/
	Intel ICH7 northbridge drivers. Incomplete / untested.

include/
	General header files.

lib/
	Library functions.

lwip/
	LWIP. (http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/)

net/
	Network card (currently only 3c90x) drivers, glue code, and the RFB
and HTTP applications. Other network drivers should go here.

netwatch/
	Main startup and initialization code, logging, SMI response, VGA text
overlay, and other general top-level sources. To build the main NetWatch binary,
run "make" here to produce aseg.elf.
 
pci/
	PCI bus interface and BAR-clobbering routines.

tools/
	Assorted useful Linux command line tools we've found useful, such as
for SMRAM segment manipulation, raw I/O port pokes, etc. These are not required
to use NetWatch.

video/
	Framebuffer drivers for VGA text and TNT2 graphics consoles. Supporting
graphics on other chipsets will require making a driver like that in tnt2.c.

---

Porting NetWatch to other systems will likely require:
- A network driver, if you don't have a 3c905 (net/3c90x.c)
- A video driver, if you are interested in graphics rather than VGA text,
  and don't have an NVidia TNT2. (video/tnt2.c)
- North- and southbridge drivers for your chipset. (ich2/)

We have found that Intel generally provides easily-accessible chipset
datasheets on their website; searching for a particular ICH series part on
Google will likely lead to the correct datasheet without too much trouble. 
Other chipset manufacturers have been found to be significantly less
cooperative.
