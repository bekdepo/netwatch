    presentation
    Requested by de0u 9/11/2008
[ ] Fix ACPI (0xB2/B3 emulation -- can we fake it?)
[.] PCI scan / module instantiation
[.] Refactor smram_* 
    First cut at splitting out ICH2 code done by jdpotter 9/12/2008
    PCI scan can be done later
[.] Update blog as needed
[X] Refactor SMI management (moving it all out to an ich2/x.c would be fine
    as pass 1 -- later it can use the PCI scan)
[ ] Synchronize headers
[ ] Fix build system...
